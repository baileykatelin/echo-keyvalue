KP: 9664: Using 16 for local hash table size (same as merge frequency), 5510000 for master hash table size
KP: 9664: Total memory allocation size (just evaluation, not kv stores themselves) could be up to 0 bytes (0 MB)
Will create 5510000 random integers for each child thread
Now starting evaluation for key-value store: kp_kvstore

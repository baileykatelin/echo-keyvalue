KP: 9840: Using 16 for local hash table size (same as merge frequency), 1610000 for master hash table size
KP: 9840: Total memory allocation size (just evaluation, not kv stores themselves) could be up to 0 bytes (0 MB)
Will create 1610000 random integers for each child thread
Now starting evaluation for key-value store: LevelDB

KP: 6208: Using 16 for local hash table size (same as merge frequency), 1610000 for master hash table size
KP: 6208: Total memory allocation size (just evaluation, not kv stores themselves) could be up to 0 bytes (0 MB)
Will create 201250 random integers for each child thread
Now starting evaluation for key-value store: Masstree
